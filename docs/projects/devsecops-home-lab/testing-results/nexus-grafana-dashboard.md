## Overview

This installation process is for creating and installing a Nexus dashboard within Grafana for monitoring purposes.

## Prerequisites

1. **Set Up Nexus Repository Manager Monitoring**

- Ensure Nexus Repository Manager is configured to expose metrics for Prometheus.
- Edit the `nexus.properties` file, typically located in the `etc/` directory within your Nexus installation:

  ```bash
  sudo nano ./apps/nexus/nexus-data/etc/nexus.properties
  ```

  Add the following property to enable Prometheus metrics:

  ```bash
  nexus.prometheus.enabled=true
  ```

- Restart Nexus for the changes to take effect:

  ```bash
  docker compose down && docker compose up -d
  ```

2. **Set Up Prometheus**

- Add Nexus as a target in the Prometheus configuration (`prometheus.yml`) by specifying its host and port:

  ```yaml
  scrape_configs:
    - job_name: "nexus"
      static_configs:
        - targets: ["<nexus_host>:<nexus_port>"]
  ```

  Replace `<nexus_host>` with your Nexus server's hostname or IP address and `<nexus_port>` with the port where Nexus is running (default is 8081).
- Start or restart Prometheus to begin collecting Nexus metrics.

## Installation Steps

3. **Import the Nexus Dashboard in Grafana**

- To visualize Nexus traffic in Grafana, follow these steps:
  1. Log in to your Grafana instance.
  2. Click on **Create** (the plus icon on the left) and select **Import**.
  3. Paste the dashboard ID: **16459**, or use the URL: [https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/16459-infra-nexus/](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/16459-infra-nexus/).
  4. Click **Load**.
  5. Select your Prometheus data source, which scrapes metrics from Nexus.
  6. Click **Import** to add the dashboard to your Grafana instance.

4. **Monitor and Refine**

- After importing, you can monitor Nexus traffic and performance metrics through the dashboard.
- Customize the dashboard as needed by refining queries or adding additional panels.
- Set up alerts in Grafana based on performance thresholds or traffic conditions to get notified proactively.

## You're Done

With this setup, Grafana will now display Nexus traffic and performance data, allowing you to monitor the health and usage of your Nexus Repository Manager effectively.
