## Triggering the OWASP Juice Shop Pipeline in Jenkins

### 1. Log into Jenkins

- Start by logging into your Jenkins server using your credentials.

### 2. Navigate to the OWASP Juice Shop Pipeline

- From the Jenkins Dashboard, locate and select the **OWASP Juice Shop** pipeline from your list of projects.

### 3. Select the Master Branch

- Inside the pipeline project, click on the **master** branch to view its details and available actions.

### 4. Trigger the Pipeline Build

- Click the **Build Now** button to manually trigger the pipeline build for the master branch.

### 5. Monitor the Pipeline Execution

- As the pipeline runs, you can monitor the execution of each stage in real-time. Jenkins will display logs and outputs for each step, allowing you to track the progress.

### 6. Verify the Deployment

- Once the pipeline has successfully completed, verify the deployment by opening a web browser and navigating to:

  ```bash
  http://<your_ip_address>:8084/
  ```

- The OWASP Juice Shop application should be accessible at this URL, confirming that the deployment was successful.

### 7. Automate Pipeline Triggers

- Note that your Gitea repository should be configured to automatically trigger this Jenkins pipeline whenever a commit is made to the master branch. This ensures continuous integration and deployment for your project.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! Your Jenkins pipeline is now set up and working. You’ve successfully triggered, monitored, and verified a build and deployment for the OWASP Juice Shop application.
